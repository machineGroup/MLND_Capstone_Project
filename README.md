# MLND_Capstone_Project
The final capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Super-resolution imaging using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)


The first stage of the project involves an attempt to replicate the base result mentioned in the paper :

Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks 
Chao Dong; Chen Change Loy; Kaiming He; Xiaoou Tang

AND to establish a proof of concept for Super Resolution using CNNs. The datasets used in Project_Part_1 (T91, Set5, Set 14 and Urban100 datasets) can be obtained from this link: 

http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/wlai24/LapSRN/

Project_Part_2 uses Manga109 dataset for training and Set5, Set14, Urban100 for model validation.

The .h5 files in each folder are the trained models which can be directly loaded and used. Future updates are expected with improved models on further training.

Note: In case you're cloning the repository and using the code, store these datasets inside the Project_Part_1 folder alongside the Project Folder. Follow the same for second part of project too.
