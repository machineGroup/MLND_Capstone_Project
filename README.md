# MLND_Capstone_Project
The final capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Super-resolution imaging using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)


The first stage of the project involves an attempt to replicate the base result mentioned in the paper :

Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks 
Chao Dong; Chen Change Loy; Kaiming He; Xiaoou Tang

AND to establish a proof of concept for Super Resolution using CNNs. The datasets used in Project_Part_1 (T91, Set5, Set 14 and Urban100 datasets) can be obtained from this link:

In case you're cloning the repository and using the code, store these datasets inside the Project_Part_1 folder alongside the Project Folder.
